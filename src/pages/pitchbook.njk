                            <h2 class="mt-4">Problem</h2>
                            <p class="">Singing instructors who teach over <strong>Skype</strong> or <strong>Zoom</strong> sometimes find it difficult to <strong>match</strong> the <strong>effectiveness</strong> of teaching in-person.</p>

                            <p>If we compare an in-person lesson with an online lesson, we're presented with the dilemma of audio lag:</p>

                            <h3 class="mt-5">User needs</h3>
                            <p>Singing teachers who teach online need a way to:</p>
                            <ul>                            
                                <li>Provide students <strong>live accompaniment</strong> for exercises they prescribe during lessons</li>
                                <li>Improve their <strong>effectiveness</strong> as vocal technicians</li>
                                <li>Maintain control of the <strong>flow</strong> and <strong>pace</strong> of each lesson</li>
                                <li><strong>Focus</strong> more on <strong>students</strong> and less on technology</li>
                            </ul>

                            <hr class="my-5">

                            <h2 class="mt-4">Solution</h2>
                            <p>The proposed solution is a responsive web app workflow tool for voice instructors that leverages a specific browser API that enables accompaniment to be quickly modified and sent to a student's device, resulting in a much more seamless and effective educational experience. An instructor would be able to connect a <strong>MIDI keyboard</strong> with the application for a seamless workflow.</p>

                            <p>I approached the problem by making <strong>research</strong> the driving force, ensuring the user's needs were met, while making sure any of my personal biases were minimized.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><a href="https://bit.ly/39yz6L4" target="_blank" class="text-info">Link to interactive prototype</a></li>
                                <li><a href="https://bit.ly/36wwEmB" target="_blank" class="text-info">Link to Figma board</a></li>
                            </ul>

                            <div class="videoWrapper mt-4 mb-4">
                              <iframe width="560" height="349" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-D18-6CVNjA?rel=0&modestbranding=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            </div>

                            <p>Based on the demo, one can see that, by using the solution, an online lesson is much more similar to an in-person lesson than before. The aformentioned needs of <strong>live accompaniment</strong>, <strong>increased effectiveness</strong>, instructor control of <strong>lesson flow</strong>, and increased <strong>focus on the student</strong> are all achieved.</p>

                            <h2 class="mt-4">Target audience</h2>
                            <p>The target audience is quite niche, since the problem is highly specific. Voice instructors who teach online lessons are the primary audience, and their students are the secondary audience.</p>

                                        <li>Used sacrificial concepts for both user types</li>
                                        <li>For instructors, proposed process idea (capturing pattern on MIDI keyboard, transmitting to student's interface, modulating pre-captured pattern); seemed viable and solved for audio lag issues</li>
                                        <li>For students, proposed interface visual idea via video recording, showing example from GarageBand:</li>

                            <p>With the aforementioned sketching as a starting place, the design evolved and pivoted as new research shed new light.</p>

                            <h3 class="mt-4">Design principles</h3>
                            <p class="mb-0">1. <strong>Keep users informed of system status</strong></p>
                            <p>Users should be aware of any relevant system mode adjustments with constant feedback and visibility</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">2. <strong>Design with aesthetics and minimalism in mind</strong></p>
                            <p>Users shouldn’t feel overloaded with information or stimuli, especially since they’re already either singing or teaching</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">3. <strong>Make systems flexible so novices and experts can choose to do more or less on them</strong></p>
                            <p class="mb-5">Users of varying levels of musical experience should be able to customize their experience with features and settings relevant to them</p>

                            <h3 class="mt-4">Other considerations</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Progressive disclosure</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Used on main view for setting parameters via dropdown menus, modals</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Vertical positioning of content for each user's context</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>An instructor's eyes go between a piano and the application interface very often, so more frequently used content is placed toward the bottom of the screen to reduce the physical distance between either target</li>
                                    <li>The student's priority is physical alignment and posture, so content was positioned toward the top of the screen to help minimize neck constriction</li>

                            </ul>

                            <h2 class="mt-4">Outcome</h2>
                            <p>The end result was a high-fidelity clickable prototype and concept, showing how to eliminate some of the issues that were initially present with online voice lessons. Many of my assumptions were validated, and some were proven false, which helped direct the project toward what the end user ultimately needs.</p>

                            <h3 class="mt-4">Challenges</h3>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Recruiting was challening sometimes, since I needed to schedule time to talk with busy instructors</li>
                                <li>Technical challenges: learned that there will be limitations in how this can be implemented as a web app (e.g. only usable with specific browsers)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 class="mt-4">Reflection</h3>

                                <li>There's value in leveraging technology to be as present as possible, even when not physically possible</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 class="mt-4">Next steps</h3>
